# asksort

asksort is a project seeking to make use of sorting algorithms to speed up the process of ranking things... What those things are depends on you, but one example would be if you have a list of shows you want to watch and want to efficiently decide the order. Making use of the concept of transitivity, asksort reads in a file (or you can paste a list of items in) and then minimizes the amount of comparisons you need to do before it outputs a list.
